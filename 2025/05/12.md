## Description

Recently, we have been busy with paper writing. Now we have finished the third paper, but unfortunately, we don't know if it will be accepted. Additionally, we have found a new and interesting direction: **fault attacks**, which involve hardware engineering and experimenting with black box modules. The initial steps are very hard, but it becomes super interesting when we successfully carry out an attack.

During this time, we have been using _Ubuntu_ as our operating system. We find that _macOS_ is quite similar to _Ubuntu_. In fact, the _Ubuntu_ desktop environment has made great progress thanks to the open-source community. During this period, we need to pay more attention to top conference papers to see how others conduct their research.

The major problem we have identified is our limited _English vocabulary_, which is not sufficient for our needs. Today, I went home early. Hoping for more great days in the future.
