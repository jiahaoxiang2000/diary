## Thoughts and Feelings

Today I also watched many videos, but had a great lunch of beef hotpot, which was very delicious. More importantly, I made progress on the paper experiment and came up with a good idea for the paper. I need to write it down and implement it. I also need to code for the paper, which is very important.
