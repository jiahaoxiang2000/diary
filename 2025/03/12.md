## Thoughts and Feelings

Today I dedicated a significant amount of time to mathematics studies - focusing on vector spaces, linear mapping definitions, and base sets. These concepts are fundamental to my research area and I'm glad I made this investment. I noticed I'm developing a more structured approach to my math learning by breaking it into multiple focused sessions throughout the day rather than one long session.

While I spent about 1.5 hours browsing tech news in the morning, it was more targeted than previous days - focusing on PQC, coding, and models that relate to my work. The information about the chip market in China was also relevant to my broader understanding of the tech landscape.

Comparing to yesterday and previous days, I'm still taking substantial rest periods in the afternoon, but I'm balancing consumption (reading news) with production (mathematics study) better than before. However, I haven't made progress on the paper experiment that I mentioned needing to work on in yesterday's reflection. This remains a priority that I'm postponing.

For tomorrow, I need to allocate dedicated time to that paper experiment - ideally in the morning when my concentration is at its peak. I should continue with mathematics studies but perhaps reduce the time spent on news and entertainment. The structured approach to learning with breaks seems effective, so I'll maintain that pattern.
