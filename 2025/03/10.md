## Thoughts and Feelings

Today was more productive than the weekend, especially with the four hours I dedicated to the weekly report and paper fixes in the morning. That continuous block of focused work was valuable, and I made good progress. However, I spent too much time browsing news in the afternoon - over three hours when I had planned to do more work on the paper experiment.

The evening lesson on arrays and lists went well, and I'm glad I took the time to add additional notes afterward while the material was still fresh in my mind. Teaching these concepts helps solidify my own understanding.
