## Description

First, let me check my browser history since my memory is limited.

This morning, I woke up early and watched some fun videos for about an hour. Then I wanted to use the `Zed` editor to work on the _CUDA_ project experiments on a remote machine.

Unfortunately, I couldn't work normally on the remote machine. The LSP server based on _Clang_ wasn't running properly, so I created an [issue](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues/27328) for the Zed editor.

I also discovered that `Zed` doesn't have retrieval augmented generation features or retrieval context indexing. I started a [discussion](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/discussions/27323) about this on the Zed GitHub page.

In the afternoon, I wrote some code for the paper experiment using `VSCode`. The results show improvement compared to the original version. I used [Python to visualize](https://github.com/jiahaoxiang2000/sphincs-plus/blob/844552900d652a1f2c04c25c13e539d07d2f136b/utils/adaptive-thread.ipynb) the results. I'm pleased that the Performance Model matches our predictions. Everything is looking good.
