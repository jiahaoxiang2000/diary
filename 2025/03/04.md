## ‚ö°Ô∏è Time allocation

Today I woke up at 7:30 am, then had breakfast. I arrived at the lab around 9:00 am. I found that macOS on the Mac Mini 4 had _crashed_, which is not the first time I've encountered this issue. Then I decided to use the 4000 ü§ë to build a personal computer with an _x86_ architecture. I searched for many tutorials on the _Bilibili_ platform.

Then I explored the **GitHub** platform to find some popular projects. I found a beautiful Chinese CV LaTeX template, so I updated my CV based on it. In the afternoon, I also needed to find tutorials about _x86_ architecture using Intel or AMD processors. Later, I returned to exploring projects and discovered [generative-ai-for-beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners) created by Microsoft. I found the project documentation to be great, so I used the [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) documentation framework to create my diary entries.

In the evening, I had a weekly report meeting where I needed to present the progress of my paper. Then, at 9:30 pm, I started writing this diary entry.

## ü§î Summary

**Computer selection:** At the end of the day, I decided not to buy a new computer because there are many things I would need to do, such as learning the _Linux_ system and then configuring the device to connect to it. This would take me a lot of time. Additionally, it might not provide great integration with my Apple products. Therefore, I will continue to use the Mac Mini 4 for now. However, the **crash issue** is still a problem that needs to be addressed. I plan to investigate potential solutions or workarounds for this issue in the coming days.

**Project exploration:** I found some interesting projects on GitHub today, especially the generative AI project by Microsoft. I noticed it does not have an action workflow file to deploy the documentation, which I found interesting. As a result, I discovered the `docsify` framework and used it to create this diary project for recording my daily life. I also updated my CV using a LaTeX template I found. This will help me present my information more professionally. The new template is clean and simple, which I really like.
