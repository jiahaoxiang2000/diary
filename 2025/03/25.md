## Description

Today, I didn't sleep much. Around 6:00 AM, I woke up and started exploring the `Zed` community to understand how features like _extensions_ and _themes_ work. At 9:00 AM, I began building the `Zed` editor following the [local development](https://zed.dev/docs/development?highlight=development#developing-zed) guide. Since this project is based on Rust, the build process was straightforward without requiring many complicated steps.

At 10:00 AM, I noticed that `Copilot Chat` lacked a thought model, so I researched online to find the appropriate thought model name. By 11:00 AM, I had created a Pull Request to add the thought model to `Copilot Chat` in this [PR](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/27409).

While searching for similar issues, I found another PR about [supporting the think model LLMs](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/27085). This inspired me to work on both the think model and UI for `Copilot Chat`. I focused on multiple code components: one for _configuration settings_, another for the _UI_, and most importantly, transforming _LLMs responses_ into UI elements. I realized the key challenge was the response transformation, while the other parts could leverage existing logic.

After several attempts, I discovered that the `Copilot Chat think model` wasn't responding with the expected `think part context`. I decided to stop coding but documented all my findings in the PR. To my surprise, the maintainers took notice quickly and merged my PR that same afternoon.

In the evening, I attended my regular weekly report meeting. Nothing particularly interesting came up, except for a reminder that I need to finish my **paper** by April 30th. I mentioned that I won't be going home soon. While I cited paper writing as the reason, honestly, the bigger factor is that I don't feel comfortable going back home right now - it's not easy for me.

Overall, it was a simple day focused on coding.
