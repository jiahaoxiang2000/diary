## Thoughts and Feelings

Today I spent much time on entertainment and tech news. The AI agent tools trend caught my attention - it seems like an area worth exploring further. I'm happy about the paper experiment showing a 10 percent improvement, which is encouraging. However, I notice I'm still spending too much time consuming content rather than creating it. For tomorrow, I should focus more on my paper work and reduce distractions. I need to build on today's experimental success and allocate more continuous time blocks for deep work. The tech posts about passwordless authentication might be useful for improving my workflow efficiency.
