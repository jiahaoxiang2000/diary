## ‚ö°Ô∏è Time allocation

Today I woke up at 7:40 am, then had breakfast. I arrived at the lab around 8:37 am. Then I watched some videos. After that, I worked on the HUFF DataStructure notes PDF for my second lesson. For lunch, I ate food provided by a junior fellow student.

At 12:20 pm, I returned to the lab and took a nap until 2:00 pm. According to my plan, I was supposed to code the third paper experiment, but I lost my passion for it. Instead, I watched some microphone tutorial videos. Until 6:30 pm, I taught a DataStructure lesson to students. Now it's 10:11 pm, and I'm writing this diary.

## ‚ÖÄ summarize

**Efficiency Analyst**: This morning I didn't accomplish much work, only prepared the PDF notes and watched many videos. In the afternoon, I didn't work on the code experiment as planned. I need to find better motivation. The evening wasn't bad though, as I conducted a lesson with students.

## üßê Predict

**Tomorrow**: I will go to the lab at 8:30 am, and then I will do the code experiment. I will try to finish the experiment.
