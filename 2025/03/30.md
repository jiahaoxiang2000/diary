## Morning

This morning, a professor met with me to introduce tools for _reading research papers_ and _managing academic literature_. Later in the morning, we worked on improving my paper's writing style, replacing casual language with more precise academic terminology.

## Afternoon

After lunch, we set up a standing desk, which I'm currently using to write this diary entry - it's quite a nice change! The professor also asked about computer equipment; I recommended the **Mac Mini 4**, which I've been using successfully. We then planned the experimental structure for my paper.

## Evening

In the evening, I conducted experiments and integrated figures into my paper. I finished by writing this diary entry.

Overall, I made good progress on my paper today. The highlight was definitely trying out the **standing desk setup**. Now it's time to head home and get some rest.
