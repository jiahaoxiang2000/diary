## Today's Events

Here I use a table to record the events of the day, which includes the start time, end time, event name, and additional information.

| Start Time | End Time | Event Name     | Additional Information    |
| ---------- | -------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| 8:00       | 8:30     | Breakfast      |                           |
| 8:56       | 11:30    | middle check   | do the table and slide    |
| 11:30      | 12:45    | Lunch          |                           |
| 12:45      | 15:00    | Rest/nap       |                           |
| 15:10      | 17:35    | read tech post | how to use LLM on coding  |
| 17:35      | 18:00    | Break          | Short walk                |

| 21:30      | 22:00    | Writing diary  |                           |

## Thoughts and Feelings

Today was reasonably productive with a good balance between focused work and rest periods. I spent a significant amount of time (about 2.5 hours) on the middle check, working on tables and slides, which was important preparation work. My afternoon rest period was quite long at over 2 hours - perhaps longer than needed, though it did help me feel refreshed afterward.

The time spent reading tech posts about using LLMs for coding was valuable and directly related to my research interests. I'm noticing a pattern where I'm becoming more intentional about the content I consume, focusing on topics that can enhance my skills rather than general news browsing like in previous days.

The evening lesson on data structure search and sort algorithms went well. Teaching these concepts continues to strengthen my own understanding, similar to yesterday's experience with arrays and lists. The short walk between activities was a good decision for maintaining mental clarity.

Compared to yesterday and previous days, today had a better balance of productive work and rest. However, I still haven't made progress on the paper experiment I mentioned needing to prioritize in earlier entries. This continues to be pushed off day after day, which is concerning.

For tomorrow, I should:

1. Allocate a specific morning time block for the paper experiment when my focus is sharpest
2. Continue the practice of taking short walks between activities
3. Reduce my afternoon rest period to 1-1.5 hours maximum
4. Build on today's learning about LLMs for coding by implementing some practical examples
