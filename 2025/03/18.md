## Description

Summer is approaching, and the sun rises earlier now. Today I woke up at 7:20 am, not feeling tired. I went to the lab at 8:20 am to check the exam arrangement table for 25 postgraduate students. We spent 2 hours on the database lesson, which included notes and exam case resources. We used _XianYu_ to purchase the resources for 20 Yuan.

In the afternoon, we browsed news on `BiliBili`, `HackNews`, and `TechMeme`. We read about the European cloud computing situation, where US companies dominate the software market, posing high risks for European governments. Then we prepared weekly report slides and presented our work to the teacher.

The reporting session lasted nearly 2 hours with all students participating. At the end, we discovered some useful extensions like the [codeBook](https://github.com/blopker/codebook) for spell checking.
We also learned many keyboard shortcuts for `Zed`, which are very useful and interesting.

## Suggestions

Today was relatively productive with a good mix of teaching responsibilities and professional development. However, I can make some improvements:

**Time Management**: I should continue waking up early as I did today (7:20 am) since I felt refreshed. The earlier start helped me be more productive in the morning.

**Focus Areas**: I'm still spending considerable time browsing news sites like BiliBili, HackNews, and TechMeme. While the European cloud computing information was relevant, I should limit general browsing to 30-45 minutes and be more intentional about what I consume.

**Paper Progress**: There was no mention of the paper experiment that I made progress on during March 15th. I need to maintain momentum on this project by allocating at least 1-2 hours daily.

**Tool Optimization**: The discovery of codeBook extension and Zed keyboard shortcuts was valuable. I should dedicate 20 minutes tomorrow to properly set up these tools and practice the shortcuts to improve my workflow efficiency.

**Teaching Preparation**: For future database lessons, I should prepare materials in advance rather than purchasing resources at the last minute. This will improve the quality of teaching and reduce stress.

**Rest Periods**: Today's diary doesn't mention any specific rest periods. I should continue maintaining balanced breaks throughout the day, preferably with short walks as I found beneficial in previous days.
