## Thoughts and Feelings

Today was a mixed day in terms of productivity. I spent the morning catching up on news and tech posts, which was interesting - particularly learning about the Einstein AI model. I'm glad I dedicated significant time to math studies both before and after lunch, focusing on vector spaces and algebraic structures. These concepts are fundamental to my research and worth the investment.

I probably rested longer than necessary in the early afternoon - nearly 2.5 hours is excessive. However, the walk in the evening was a good decision for my physical and mental well-being. The three hours spent on the weekly report were productive and necessary. Moving forward, I should try to start my focused work earlier in the day and limit my rest periods. Tomorrow, I need to allocate more time to my paper experiment that I've been postponing for several days now.
