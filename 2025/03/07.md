## Thoughts and Feelings

Today I had a lot of time to watch videos; it was also a day without work. I should be careful about spending too much time on suggested videos and avoid getting distracted. I need to push forward with the coding for my third paper as there's not much time left - only one day, since I'll only have half days available on Saturday and Sunday to work on it. I need to focus!
