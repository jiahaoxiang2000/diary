## Description

Today I purchased a _Sony_ WH-1000XM5 headphone headset. It was released in 2023 and has excellent sound quality and noise cancellation, making it a great choice for me. In the morning, we had a three-hour database lesson.

In the afternoon, we used DuckDB in our lesson and practiced with `REPL` technology for our exercises. We also discovered that our `qq-bot` had shut down. We initially thought it was caused by a QQ update, but we'll need to monitor it further next time.

In the evening, we performed reverse engineering on the _School ID Card_. We found that it stores identity information in section 0 and block 0, which is the card's **UID**. The data is not encrypted, making it easy to read and copy using a `CUID` card. This presents a significant security risk.
