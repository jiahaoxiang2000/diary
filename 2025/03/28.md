## Morning Activities

- At 8:50 AM, I reviewed comments from my boss.
- Provided feedback on an undergraduate student's weekly report.
- Assisted a classmate with a small experiment.
- Worked on our paper that has issues with overly conversational writing style (referenced in [GitHub issue #1](https://github.com/jiahaoxiang2000/ThirdPaper/issues/1)) - we need to revise all content.
- Attempted to improve our figures by adding shadows and transparency, but these effects didn't work properly on vector graphics, so no improvements were made to the final version.

## Afternoon Activities

- Read a blog about how [Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://www.anthropic.com/research/tracing-thoughts-language-model) work. This provided interesting insights for optimizing models and investigating LLM output content.

## Evening Activities

- Held a feedback session with an undergraduate student regarding their weekly report.
- Found an adjustable-height desk that will allow me to code while standing up.
