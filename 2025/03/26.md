## Description

Today I attempted to register an Anthropic account but was unable to complete the process because I didn't have access to a phone number for verification. This halted my registration.

I then spent six hours working on class materials, including detailed lesson notes and preparing a speech for a class on data structures.

Another important task I completed was creating the [typesetting](https://github.com/jiahaoxiang2000/typesetting) project for LaTeX typesetting of notes and slides. When setting up the GitHub repository, I initially planned to use the Issues function to link code with specific functionality. However, I ultimately decided that using Pull Requests would be more effective. By creating new branches for features, all related code would be easier to locate and review.
