## Thoughts and Feelings

Today was a good balance between productivity and leisure. I made significant progress on the SPX experiment and coding, especially with the new dynamic programming implementation for throughput optimization. These advancements are directly related to the paper I've been postponing work on for several days, so it feels rewarding to finally make tangible progress.

The morning news browsing about multi-agent LLM systems was relevant to my research interests, and I'm noticing I'm becoming more selective about the content I consume. Similarly, the evening time spent looking at popular GitHub projects was educational rather than purely entertainment.

Dinner with teacher fans was a nice social break, which helped refresh my mind. I'm pleased that I dedicated a full two hours to the paper experiment in the evening, building on the coding progress from earlier in the day.

Looking back at previous days, I'm seeing improvement in how I allocate my time. I'm spending less time on general news browsing and more on targeted learning and project work. However, my afternoon rest periods are still quite long at 1.5 hours - I might benefit from reducing this slightly.

For tomorrow and the coming week, I should:

1. Continue the momentum on the paper experiment - set a specific goal to complete a defined portion of it
2. Consider shortening my afternoon rest to 1 hour maximum
3. Maintain the balance between focused work and breaks that I achieved today
4. Build on the SPX dynamic programming implementation by analyzing the results and incorporating them into the paper
5. Continue being selective about content consumption, prioritizing materials that directly enhance my research and coding skills
