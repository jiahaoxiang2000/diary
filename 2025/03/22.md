## Description

Today I woke up as usual, though I can't clearly remember what time. My memory isn't as good as it used to be. In the morning, I taught a 3-hour _lesson_ focused on exam questions.

During lunch break, I caught up on some news, then reviewed the `Zed` documentation and their roadmap. I was particularly interested in their _course prediction_ module fine-tuned with the **Qwen-Coder-2.5-7B** model. This represents an exciting new direction in AI development - using powerful base models and **fine-tuning** them for specific tasks.

In the evening, I continued studying the `Zed` documentation and discovered some useful shortcuts for VIM mode, such as the `f` and `t` commands for jumping to characters within a line. These shortcuts will help improve my efficiency and productivity.

Overall, today was a good day for learning more about AI and its applications.
