## ⚡️ Time allocation

Today I woke up at 7:40 am, then had breakfast. I arrived at the lab around 8:40 am. I wanted to use a QQ manager bot to add advertising to the QQ group. I found that the `go-cqhttp` project is outdated because QQ has updated their framework to `NTQQ`, so the old API reverse engineering method is no longer working. Instead, I discovered the [NapCatQQ](https://github.com/NapNeko/NapCatQQ) project, which hooks into the `NTQQ` API.

In the afternoon, I explored how the `NapCatQQ` project utilizes the API framework, then coded and tested the bot. Finally, I wrote a post and created a [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1539ZYFEsn) showcasing the results. It was a busy but productive day.
