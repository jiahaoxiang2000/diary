## Description

Today we arrived early at the lab to prepare materials for the _LLM USE Tutor_ for students. We waited for two hours, but the session was delayed. We received a task to create a PowerPoint presentation based on a book. This task is challenging because we need to closely follow the book's content, but also create similar context for the PowerPoint. For a more efficient approach, we can use [book2ppt](https://github.com/jiahaoxiang2000/book2ppt).

Unfortunately, we couldn't finish the _LLM USE Tutor_ lesson as it was delayed until Sunday. During the afternoon and evening, we attended three online sessions, leaving no time to work on our paper.

We urgently need to complete our paper with only two weeks remaining. We must quickly focus on the _FLP_ part of the project.
