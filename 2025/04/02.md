## Morning

This morning, we worked on fixing the [package issue by removing PDF files from resource files](https://github.com/jiahaoxiang2000/typesetting/issues/7). Instead, we now compile PDF files via GitHub Action workflows. This approach helps reduce the package size significantly. The PDF files have been moved to the [release page](https://github.com/jiahaoxiang2000/typesetting/releases) for easier access.

## Afternoon

In the afternoon, we decided not to work on the paper. Instead, we focused on learning mathematics, specifically about [linear mapping to matrices](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1kkfKYyEet/). We created a video on Bilibili - our 100th video! Currently, we only have 108 fans, but I'm confident this will improve in the future with continued effort.

## Evening

In the evening, I discussed biotech techniques with Tao. Later, my sister called to tell me she didn't do well on her exam. I'm uncertain about what path she should take, especially since I'm still figuring out my own direction. Whether to enter the workforce or continue studying - neither choice is inherently better than the other. What matters is that we stay committed to whatever we choose. I believe things will improve for both of us if we dedicate ourselves and pay attention to what truly matters in life.
