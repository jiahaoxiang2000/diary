## Description

At the start of the day, I discovered a software called _[MouseLess](https://mouseless.click/)_ that allows users to perform operations quickly without moving their hands to the mouse. Unfortunately, this application requires payment and isn't cheap. Looking for a free alternative, I found [ShortCat](https://shortcat.app/), which provides similar functionality without cost. It's worth noting that MacOS applications often have premium paid features that differ from their Linux or Windows counterparts.

In the afternoon and evening, I worked on completing the [hu_paper](https://github.com/jiahaoxiang2000/hu_paper/issues/1). I utilized multi-editor chat to run tasks in _parallel_, which improved my efficiency. After finishing the paper work, I wrote this diary entry.
