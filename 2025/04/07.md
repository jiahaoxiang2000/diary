## Description

This morning, we checked our Gmail inbox and found that two pull requests were merged: the [News Now Add Doc](https://github.com/ourongxing/newsnow/pull/122) and the [Add Bilibili Video Source](https://github.com/ourongxing/newsnow/pull/123#event-17143645985). The pull requests were processed quickly, just one day after submission, which is great progress for us.

Additionally this morning, we added experimental data to the experiment section of our paper. We still have one subsection of the experiment section remaining, which we plan to complete this week.

In the afternoon, we explored some popular projects on _GitHub_. We discovered many **MCP** type projects serving as frameworks for LLM models. Last week, **agent**-type projects were also trending. This year has seen LLMs expanding into many fields, with **MCP**-type projects emerging as the next hot trend.

In the evening, we examined how the [f2](https://github.com/Johnserf-Seed/f2/projects) project operates within an open community. There's no shortage of user issues, and if we decide to open-source our code, using LLM tools to accelerate the _issue resolution process_ could be a productive direction.

Finally, we completed one subsection of the experiment section of our paper. Everything is going well, and we'll head home early for a relaxing bath.
