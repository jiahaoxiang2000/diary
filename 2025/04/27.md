## Description

In the morning, we checked the news but didn't find anything particularly interesting. Then, we focused on highlighting the changes made to our paper this week ([see commit](https://github.com/jiahaoxiang2000/ThirdPaper/commit/df56022a395d32adc72e1f204637ce44850efb5c)).

After lunch, we worked on converting the paper's results from tables to figures ([see commit](https://github.com/jiahaoxiang2000/ThirdPaper/commit/613ea1955e9bff70028f3ec2f829c963725ed16e)). This means the paper is basically finished, with not much left to improve.

In the evening, we collected all the data needed for [journal submission](https://github.com/jiahaoxiang2000/ThirdPaper/issues/9). By 9 PM, it was time to write this diary entry.

In conclusion, today was a _paper day_.
