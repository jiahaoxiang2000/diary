## Description

In the morning, we tried to find a _Letter type paper journal_. However, there weren't many journals to choose from. We decided to use the **GPT-3o** model to search for journals and found that the 3o model performed better than the earlier version. The journal table can be found [online](https://github.com/jiahaoxiang2000/weekly_report/blob/main/2025/04/2025-04-21.pdf).

In the afternoon, we read some news about the hot topic of traffic between China and the US. For English learning, we used the _ShanBei_ app to practice English. Later in the evening, we focused on fixing our paper's [symbol issue](https://github.com/jiahaoxiang2000/ThirdPaper/issues/7). Finally, I wrote this diary entry to end the day.
