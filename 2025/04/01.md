## Description

Today I spent six hours examining Rust code related to the "Clang LSP not working on SSH remote" issue in the Zed editor ([GitHub issue #27328](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues/27328)). Zed uses a _protocol layer_ to separate editor functionality from implementation, allowing it to work both locally and over SSH remote connections. This is an excellent design pattern.

However, I encountered several challenges:

- The Rust compile time is problematic during development
- The server-remote-client architecture requires independent components to be developed separately
- Rust's deeply nested code structure makes the codebase difficult to read and maintain
  - The selection logic is scattered throughout the code, making it hard to follow

Additionally, my supervisor mentioned that our paper processing is behind schedule. We need to dedicate more time to complete it before April 30th.
