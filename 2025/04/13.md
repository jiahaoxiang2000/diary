## Description

At the start of the day, we explored trending projects and discovered [CosyVoice](https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/CosyVoice), a voice creation project that produces excellent results for my video work. We also completed our paper experiment setup by creating a [project template](https://github.com/users/jiahaoxiang2000/projects/1) that visually organizes our required tasks.

We tested _Gemini 2.5 Pro_ with its impressive 2M context window size, but the results weren't satisfactory. For paper writing, we found that _Sonnet 3.7 Think_ performs best.

In the afternoon, we attended a lesson about AI tools for multimedia students. The basic _text2text_ tasks worked well, but the _text2image_ and _text2video_ results were disappointing, with videos only 6-12 seconds long.

During the evening, we reviewed 183 papers from the past 20 years on [IACR](https://www.iacr.org/cryptodb/data/bestpapers.php) to understand cryptography research better. This will inform our fourth paper, where we aim to delve deeper into cryptography by providing accurate security levels based on mathematical assumptions and implementing verification. Completing these components would elevate our work to standard paper quality, unlike our previous efforts.

Let's channel our passion into cryptography!
