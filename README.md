# Diary

## Motivation

Sometimes, I will lose some passion or target; I will write some diary entries to record my feelings and thoughts.
Let the thinking then do it and record what things happen. By the way, I can study the past and improve the future.
This is the _reason_ why I write the diary.

## Structure

we use the year and month as the folder name, and the file name is the date.
For example, the file path is `2021/01/01.md`. For navigation on the `docsify` sidebar, we use the [Diary entries](#diary-entries) to generate the navigation.
